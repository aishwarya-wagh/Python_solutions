# python_solutions

Welcome to the `python_solutions` repository! This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges from Leetcode, as well as other Python practice problems. The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and to help others who are also preparing for technical interviews or looking to improve their problem-solving skills in Python.

## Overview

This repository is organized by problem type and difficulty level. Each solution includes the problem statement, my approach, and the Python code implementation. I aim to cover a wide range of topics and problem types to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone studying algorithms and data structures.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
python_solutions/
│
├── easy/
│   ├── problem_1.py
│   ├── problem_2.py
│   └── ...
│
├── medium/

└── utils.py
```

- **easy/**: Contains solutions to easy-level problems.
- **medium/**: Contains solutions to medium-level problems.
- **hard/**: Contains solutions to hard-level problems.
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions that might be used across multiple solutions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python_solutions.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd python_solutions
```

3. Browse through the folders (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`) to find the solutions you are interested in.

4. Each Python file contains the problem statement as a comment at the top, followed by the solution.
